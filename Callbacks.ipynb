    "## Usage of callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument callbacks) to the .fit() method of the Sequential or Model classes. The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training."
